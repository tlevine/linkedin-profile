I want to see what happens if I create a meaning-void LinkedIn profile of buzzwords.

Compile and run `big-data-scientist.hs`. It will give a list of meat words and
fascia words. These lists will be in a random order. Use these lists to compose
a meaningless bulleted description of your past experience.

1. Start the first bullet with a fascia word. You will follow it by a meat
    word, and you should adjust the parts of speech to make them fit.
2. Continue stringing meat words together, adjusting their parts of speech and
    adding stop words and other small words as you think makes sense.
3. If adjusting the parts of speech doesn't help, add a fascia word in between
    two meat words.
4. If adding the fascia word doesn't help connect adjacent meat words, end the
    current bullet at the first of the two meat words, and use the fascia word
    and the second of the meat words to start the next bullet.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until you have four bullets.
