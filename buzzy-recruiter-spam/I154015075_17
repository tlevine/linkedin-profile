Hi Thomas, 

I think your background looks great for a Data Engineer role we have opening up here at Gilt Groupe here in New York City.

Gilt Groupe, www.gilt.com , is an innovative online shopping destination offering its members special access to the most inspiring merchandise, culinary offerings, and experiences every day, many at insider prices. This is a well funded Pre-IPO blue chip venture backed with 950+ employees, growing rapidly and continuing building out our technical operations. All executives are top talent from Double Click, Expedia, Amazon, and Yahoo just to name a few.

At a minimum if you were not interested, you may know of some folks in industry that may be a fit. I would welcome the opportunity to set up a quick 15 minute call at your convenience to speak further. I look forward to hearing back from you.
