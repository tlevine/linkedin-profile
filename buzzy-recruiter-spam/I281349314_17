Hi Thomas, 

Just curious if you might be interested in a new opportunity. I'm working with a couple software firms New York looking to bring on full-time data scientists to deal with terabytes of structured and unstructured social media data that they are analyzing for actionable, marketable signals using distributed computing/big data technology like Hadoop. They basically need to hire candidates with extremely strong math skills and some programming ability, ideally with distributed systems. Let
me know if this sounds interesting or if you might know the person for the job.
