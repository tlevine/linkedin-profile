Thomas, 

Wanted to quickly ping you regarding a high level Data Scientist role for one of NYC's top startups - Dataminr. 

They are THE startup analyizing social media data to predict and break news / events. 

Headcount of 25, 7 million in series A, raising another 50 million right now. 

They just signed a partnership with Twitter to access its firehose (340MM tweets a day) and analyze their data in dozens of ways, helping surface breaking news, critical information or highlighting trends from emerging events. 

Long story short, we are searching for a very well Data Scientist. There is much more I can tell you, but figured I would run it by first and see if you had any interest in exploring further. 

Please let me know if you are looking or if you can recommend someone?
